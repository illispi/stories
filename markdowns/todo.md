page 8 (skip 3) -> page 11 -> page 8 (This works for now)

page 8 -> page 9 -> set something -> page 8 -> skip (no) -> clear page 9 and so on

1. page 8
   - set something to LS if has skip property, and yes

2. page 9
   - should increment that LS on submit

3. page 8 on skip
   - take how much increment is and delete values based on the personalQuestions Array

NOTE has to increment even the previous ones as well
valuesAfterFirst + + + +
    valuesAfterSecond + + 

Or does it need to stop before next skip?
